# NEAT in rust

Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) is a method to dynamically evole a neural network to maximize the performance (fitness) for certain tasks, the original paper can be found [here](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf). 
This is a rust implementation that is inspired by the original papar as well as [evo-NEAT](https://github.com/vishnugh/evo-NEAT) and the [neat-python](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python) project.
